<h1 align="center">Basic structure for future tailwind projects</h1>

Tailwind can make work easier because it works on a different _abstraction level_.

It's the same concept we often use within JavaScript code. Instead of building interfaces in the browser using JavaScript directly, we’ll use React instead for example, which is an abstraction that makes our lives better.

We’ll do the same with CSS by using Tailwind.

Tailwind is a way to apply CSS by using _special HTML classes._
